# MLD Playground

This is my personal playground for anything web related, in a monorepo thanks to [Nx](https://nx.dev/).

I use this as a way to learn new technologies or experiment with the ones I already know.

While this repository somewhat reflects how I develop things, bear in mind that it's a toy.
I allow myself to take shortcuts when I feel like it. This includes but is not limited to:

- not adding tests
- not documenting things
- not making things re-usable
- ignoring responsive design
- ignoring aria attributes
- storing non-important private keys

## Accessing applications

All applications are automatically deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
You can access any of them at `https://mld-{app-name}.herokuapp.com`
(you might have to wait a few seconds if the instance has not received traffic recently).
